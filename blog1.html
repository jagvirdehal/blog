<h1>SQL or SQHell?</h1>
<p>
I’ve been programming for over 4 years with languages such as Python, Javascript, C# and C++. Throughout my time, I completely forgot what it feels like to be a brand new programmer, but SQL really brought that back for me. SQL is not your typical programming language, and if it wasn’t for Wikipedia I wouldn’t call it a programming language at all! Programming with SQL is like editing an Excel spreadsheet, but instead of just typing data into cells, you have to enter everything in queries, basically over-complicated commands that only make sense in hind-sight. Doing something so simple such as viewing the data in a table needs to be entered and processed through queries. Just imagine having to type a line of code every time you want to LOOK at the sheet that you’re editing. But SQL is far from being a bad language. In fact, I spent most of my time working with and integrating it into our app. My frustration comes from my lack of experience in an uncharted territory. I was just using a language that I’ve never seen before, and many simple actions felt unintuitive at first. However, as I used it more and more, I learned that SQL was actually a very powerful and robust language. The alternative to SQL would have been to store one large two-dimensional array, and have specific Javascript code to filter through and insert data manually. This could have taken hours of programming, including debugging and implementation. However, with SQL I was able to do each task with just a SINGLE, short line of code that was easy to understand and edit. Like any programming language, it’s difficult to understand and use at first, but once you get the hang of it, it is a very powerful tool to add to your arsenal.
